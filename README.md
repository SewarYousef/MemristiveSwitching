 The problem of memristive switching optimization has a
 few facets. Minimizing Joule heat, switching time, or a com
bination of the two are possibilities. Furthermore, memristive
 devices can be described using ideal models, memristive
 models, or probabilistic models. Lastly, the
 optimization problem can be formulated with application
specific constraints and/or physics-based constraints. The high
est voltage that can be used in the circuit or the compliance
 current to prevent the device from being damaged are the
 constraint examples.

In this repository, you will find two files; the NN model with Joule Loss explains how we tried to apply a target model to try to get the best neural network that reacts the same as that specified model, and the other file shows how we applied the Generic Algorithm to neural network to get the best loss values after building multiple generations.

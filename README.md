 The problem of memristive switching optimization has a
 few facets. Minimizing Joule heat, switching time, or a com
bination of the two are possibilities. Furthermore, memristive
 devices can be described using ideal models, memristive
 models, or probabilistic models. Lastly, the
 optimization problem can be formulated with application
specific constraints and/or physics-based constraints. The high
est voltage that can be used in the circuit or the compliance
 current to prevent the device from being damaged are the
 constraint examples.

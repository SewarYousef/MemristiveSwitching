 The problem of memristive switching optimization has a
 few facets. Minimizing Joule heat, switching time, or a com
bination of the two are possibilities. Furthermore, memristive
 devices can be described using ideal models [1], memristive
 models [2]–[4], or probabilistic models [5]–[8]. Lastly, the
 optimization problem can be formulated with application
specific constraints and/or physics-based constraints. The high
est voltage that can be used in the circuit or the compliance
 current to prevent the device from being damaged are the
 constraint examples.
